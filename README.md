# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation-KMeans-Silhouette-RFM

Credit Card customer Segmentation is simply grouping customers with similar characteristics. These characteristics include number of visits to bank, total visit online and taotal calls made. Clustering is an efficient technique used for customer segmentation.

Clustering algorithms include the K-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN. In this project, the k-means clustering algorithm has been applied in customer segmentation.

K-means is a clustering algorithm based on the principle of partition. The letter k represents the number of clusters chosen. It is the most common centroid-based algorithm.

In this project Kmeans clustering is used with silhouette score and finally RFM has been calculated.
